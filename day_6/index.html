		<h2><strong>July 9</strong></h2>
		
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Today we learnt about basics of 3D printing. Even though it has become one of the most attarctive technological developments recently, 3D printing still has its own limitations and can only be beneficial if used properly. As for my final project, I don't think, at this point, there's any part in my design that has to be 3D printed, given that all the components are fairly big and simple. I did find a 3D printed part from the kit that can be used in my cat feeder, as the picture shown below. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  I used OnShape to visulize my design. The upper container part would be made out of a 1.5 L straight water bottle, as the cylinder I modelled. The base would be created with hot glue and cardboard, forming a hollow box to fit in the stepper motor and wire connections. I designed a inclined surface for the cat food to slide down. If the power supply would provide enough torque against the weight of the cat food was one of the most tricky problmes. After talking to th einstructor, I decided to keep everything in the horizontal direction for maximum contact surface area, so a smaller torgue would be required.  <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For the turning gate, I designed a two-part rotation device. The semicircle at the bottono acts to turn on/off the path for cat food. I experimented with a protitype that I made with cardboard, and it turned out to be smoother if I covered the surface of the cardboard with plastic. These two pieces have the potentila to be lazer-cut, as their materials need to be something more durable that card boards since they contact with cat food all the time. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; My main goal for the next week is to figure out the mounting part with the stepper motor. In my previous design, I simply created a extruded hollow semi-circle part to drive the motor, and in thh prototype I used tape. For my finla result, I'm definitely looking for something more presentable and precise. I found this example online, which could be useful together with the 3D printed bracket included in the kit. However, I'm planning to talk to the instructor for further advice, and modify my modal accordingly.  &nbsp;   <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I created a simple geometric shpae to try out the prusa Slicer, yet for some reason it wouldn't successfully process that. I have the error message here and will come back to it after asking for help.   <br></p>



	<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Update: Problem fixed and documented on the page for Day 7. It ended up being that the thickness of the base was too thin to be 3D printed.   <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; For the second part of the assignment, I used an ios app called Capture. It would be a lot easier if I could use the rear camera. I tried to scan my cup, and even though it's not perfect (at all), I was still quite impressed about how it roughly shows a 3D shape.&nbsp;   <br></p>
