	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The topic of this class was around contorlling stepper motor, which is the most important mechanic for my final project. At the beginning, I was a little confused about how a stepper motor works as well as the wiring part. I kept unplugging and plugging back all my wires to get it work. When I tested my motor, I used the steps-per-revolution example on Arduino, yet teh code did not work as intended -- my motor wouldn't go a full circle. At last, I figured out the proper values I needed, while I still don't understand why it didn;t go a full circle. <br></p>


	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Starting from there, I went to Firebase and Arduino trying to build a connection between my device and my Huzzah board. Last week, I tried to control the motor with JavaScript directly, which was super conplicated. I started over with Arduino communicating in between. I improved my code in Arduino and went back to firebase to test it out. And it worked. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To further simplify the operation, I went back add a web app to my Firebase project, and created a webpage with a button. This was exactly where I was confused for the entire week last time. This webpage only tells the Arduino a single command to trigger the following codes that control the Huzzah board. After learning from several tutorials and talking  to the instructor, I figured it out and even added extra elements to make this webpage prettier(?).  <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As for my final project, I put all parts together to create a rough product. Because I didn;t do any of the screwing, it wasn't stable when the stepper motor was moving, which is why it wasn't included in the video above. (I finish the water right before my trial, so there were drops of water left inside...) This device worked as intended for the most parts, while there are still improvements I need to working on in the next week. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Design a safety cap at the top of the tube so the cat won't directly dig in his food <br></p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (2) Make a better connection between the disk and the tube. For this week, I just had little cuts around the edge to tuck in the disk and finished with clear tape. <br></p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (3) Add more content to the button page <br></p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (4) Maybe add an extra function to it, such as the button can only be clicked once per 24 hrs with a timer next to it. <br></p>
