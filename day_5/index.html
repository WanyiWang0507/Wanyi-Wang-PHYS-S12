	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The focus of today's class was still on Arduino. At first, we learnt about the conditional statements (If) on Arduino. The circuit I built invovled a button that controled the LED on the Metro board. A resister was added to the circuit as a puuldown resistor to avoid "floating" voltage that might impact the stability of the circuit. The video below shows a simple example of clicking the button to turn on/off the LED. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  For the in-class exercise on this topic, I programmed to count the number of button pushes, as well as a LED that would only be turned on if both buttons are clicked on. I'll be focusing on the first circuit in this documentation. I started off a little confused, which is reflected in the code below. By analyzing bugs in it, I had a better understanding on "setup" and the layered structure of Arduino code. After that, I was able to create my own code which worked okay. I had to divide all my printed values by 2654 though, because once I clicked on the button, the computor already processed for thousands of times. It was definiely as coincident for me to be able to do this, given the slight changes in time every time I clicked the button. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; By referencing from the Arduino example "StateChangeDetection", I added an extra line to my code and solved my previous problem. It states that the action would only be counted if the button state is different from the previous one. As a result, it only counts once when I clicked on the button, becasue after that the buttonstate would be the same as the previous one, causing the counting to pause. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Another important Arduino programming I learnt about was loop. Elements within a loop are executed repetitively. The statements inside the loop can include conditional statements, and vice versa. The "for"loop is useful in simplifying the code. I also completed two exercises for this topic, as shown in the instructioc. I had more difficulties on the second one,  turning on an LED responding to a button and then dimming the LED over 2.5 seconds. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The picture below shows the main part of my code. I referenced from the Arduino example "fading" for the dimming function. At the beginning, the LED performed the dimming process twice every once I clicked on the button. I figured it was because the bouncing button triggered the code twice, from low to high then back to low. I modified my code accordingly, and it functions as expected in the video below.   <br></p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  There are three components to the assignment. The first one was to continue working on Arduino. I created my own circuit and programming, which    <br></p>



      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The second part was about 3D modeling. I still chose to work with OnShape, yet I was able to easily apply the Fusion 360 tutorial in this assignment. I created a lampshade, primarily using the "revolve" and 'extrude" functions. I was surprised by how helpful spliting my design in to different parts and indivisually working with them was, even though I've been knowing this function for a while. I also explored more on the "extrude-symmetric" function, which allowed my to create the beautiful pattern. When I first saw something like this, I would instantaneously think of hollowing a big part, but this exercise provided me with a different way of thinking-- to revolve the extruded part instead of removing from the entity. Here is the final product, which I modified a little bit from the tutorial by reducing the number of circular pattern.  <br></p>

       <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The last part of th assignment was about the final project. I finalized my idea to be a remote-controlled cat feeder, which would be connected to my phone. Due to its intended size, I decided to purchase a simple model from Amazon, as shown below. This kind of gravity feeder has a lot of prolems, including overfeeding the cat, spilling and lack of flexibility in timing, accoridng to people's comments. I will only apply the purchased item as a basic shape of my final project, adding on features like a remote-controlled motor to create a gate. I also had other ideas about extending its function to thing like toys with bubble wrap, accroding to my initial project proposal. However, by talking to the intructor, we both agree that I should be ranking these features and focusing on the major part due to material and time concerns. As a result, I will keep learning about remote controls and prototyping the rotating gate for my final project.<br></p>
