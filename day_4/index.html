		<h2><strong>July 2</strong></h2>
		
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The goal of this class was to leanr about teh basics of circuit and get familiar with settiing up circuits on a breadboard. We started with learning about current and voltage. Current flows through a circuit, and votage describes the energy of teh charges at a particular place in the circuit. The first exercise was to set up a basic circuit taht consists of a resistor and a LED. A microcontroller provides a 3.3v voltage in this particular case. The longer leg of teh LED goes to the anode(positive side) of the circuit. I was able to better understand the way a breadboard works, allowing current to flow under each row and colume. To enclose my circuit, I needed to use wires to make connections across rows and columns. This pictures shows the LED being lighted up. <br></p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A multimeter was used to measure the voltage drop, the loss in electric potential. With a multimeter, I proved that the voltage drop around each component in the circuit adds up to the total voltage around the power supply. I used multimeter later in the class for debugging my circuit as well. I used the probes of the multimeter and attached them to the ends of each segment of the wires, in order to detect the discconneted spot according to the beeping sound.  <br></p>

	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;I then silulated two simple circuit on Tinkercad. I used Tinkercad to complete simulations of different types of circuit. Tinkercad is a great tool for foreseeing the circuit before building a physical one. I learnt about the color coding rules for resistors, on which different colored strips represent the number of significant figures and teh multiplier. </p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I also learnt how to use Arbuino to communicate with the Metro MO microcontroller. By importing a example program, I successfully made connection between my laptop and the microcontroller. As shown in the video below, the red LED on the microcontroller is "blinking". <br></p>

	<p>  &nbsp; &nbsp;During the lab, I learnt to measure the varying voltage drop around a potentiometer. With the Microcontroller in (ADC). I had a hard time setting up my circuit, with the measurement fluctuating between 0.01v and 0.02v. The multimeter came handy in this case to help locate the problem in my circuit.<br></p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; After class, I explored on two different ways of connecting two resistors, in series and in parallel, as what I did on Tinkcad early. Two resistors connected in series can be used as a voltage divider, because there is a voltage drop after each resistor. According to Ohm's Law (I=V/R), I was able to calculate the current in this circuit with measurements taken by the multimeter. As for the parallel circuit, I used the same method to measure voltage drop and calculate current. I found that the voltage drop around one of the resistors equals to the one around the power supplier. I also found that the more identical parallel resistors I added, the less total resistance this structure had.  <br></p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Considering that my final project may contain two or more electric conponents, I decided to experiment on the efficiency of parallel circuit and series sircuit. Because in a parallel structure, the voltage around each branch are the same as the total voltage, it works better in providing enough energy for different parts of my design. Also, when I tried to cut off one branch from the parallel ciruit, the rest were still functioning. When I did the same thing to the one in series, the entire circuit was broken. This finding also contributes to why I prefer a parallel circuit in my final project.  <br></p>

     <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The power inside different colors of LED is another thing I explore after class. I tried to substitute the red LED from my basic circuit with LEDs in other color. I found that the voltage drop around them indeed changed (unfortunately, as we tried duirng lab time, Tinkercad wasn't able to show this). I then looked at the I-V curve of resistors and LEDs. The slope of the graph shows the resistance (Ohm's Law) and the area under show the power (P=VI) The I-V curve for resistors has a constant slope(1/R), meaning a constant resistance. The voltage of LEDs shows a very small change acccording to the graph.
