		<h2><strong>July 2</strong></h2>
		
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In today's class, I learnt to use Arbuino to communicate with my metroboard. Because I did not have any experience with coding before, coding on Arduino was a little confusing at the beginning. I learn about the difference between "digital" and "analog". "Digital" marks a binary operation (ex. low and high) yet "analog" quantitatively defines it (ex. a number between 0-255). I used the following code as an example, trying to understanding the basics about Arduino step by step. I felt a lot better after this simple example, as the structure of it can also be applied in more complicated tasks. <br></p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I also tried to change the code for vairous commands, such as speed and direction.  <br></p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I then learnt about how to drive a motor with a L9110 motor drive. I chose to working with the stronger Canon motor. The key for me was to make sure that ground (GND) and power input are tightly connected to proper positions.  <br></p>

	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Another useful skill I learnt was to change the speed of the motor by a potentiometer. The potentiometer acted as a voltage divider. As its resistance varies, the voltage was divided by different ratios between the motor and the potentiometer, resulting in different speeds on the motor. Here is a picture of the finished circuit. </p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I experimented the vairous speed with a piece of fan-shaped cardboard.   <br></p>

	 <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;For the assignment, I made a kinetic sculpture inspired by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenakistiscope">phenakistoscope</a>, a traditional animation device. It uses the concept of Persistence of Vision to present a animated design.  <br></p>

	 <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;The potentiometer circuit I used in class was helpful in changing the speed of the wheel. It was a lot easier with the potentiometer to adjust the rotating speed of the wheel. I also changed to the smaller motor I got from the kit, given the the Canon one moved so fast that the image got very blury. Here's a picture of the established product. <br></p>

     <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  I split the circle into 12 equal parts and sketched a simple picture with different movements. I created 12 open spaces, which are used later for viewing purposes. I completed several trials to before it functioned, adjusting the size and shape of this piece of paper.   <br></p>

     <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Another difficulty I encourtered was to attached my paper to the motor. For a better presentation of my project, I went to get a hot glue gun. Because contact area at the end of the motor was to small, hot glue was not able to stay stably on it. I chose to used a stack of cardboards to gradully increase the contact area, and it worked effectively. At the end of the stack, I put a double-layered cardboard and poked a hole to increate the contact area for hot-gluing.

	 <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; This vidoe shows how the final product works, yet filming the amimated effect with a phone was hard. When looking at a mirror placed on the opposite of my device, I was able to see the butterfly "flying".  I would imporve my dedign by increasing the size of the hollows around, or attached a sensor with LED for additional light source.     <br></p>
