		<p>First day of class! I learnt about so many interesting idea from other participants. My idea is to build a device for my cat that combines a feeding mechanism and a few different toys. Because he is only allowed to stay in half of the house, I want my design to include a remote control that connects to my phone, so I can give him water and food from my bedroom. Bubble wrap is his favorite toy, so I might make a toy out of it which plays a sound or music when he plays with the bubbles. </p>
