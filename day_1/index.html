    <p style='margin: 70px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal; font-family: "Arial";'><span style="font-kerning: none;">I learnt about so many interesting idea from other participants. My idea is to build a device for my cat that combines a feeding mechanism and a few different toys. Because he is only allowed to stay in half of the house, I want my design to include a remote control that connects to my phone, so I can give him water and food from my bedroom. Bubble wrap is his favorite toy, so I might make a toy out of it which plays a sound or music when he plays with the bubbles.<br></span></p>
