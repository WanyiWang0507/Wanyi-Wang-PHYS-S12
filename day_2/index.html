	<p style='margin: 30px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: "Arial";'><span style="font-kerning: none;">Based on my previous experience, I chose OnShape as the tool I used. During class period, I completed a simple exercise following a tutorial video. This is the final result. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p style='margin: 30px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: "Arial";'><span style="font-kerning: none;">While the other two are relatively straight forward, I stuggled at first with recreating the wheel. I tried multiple ways to mimic the smallers parts around its main body. I observed that they are presented is different positions for both sides of the wheel, so I started off with a groups of concentric circles according to the measurements I took with the caliper.<br></span></p>

    <p style='margin: 30px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: "Arial";'><span style="font-kerning: none;">I then used "extrude" to create the hollow part of the wheel. As I notice that the center parts should not be extruded all the way through, I did "remove" to dig the holes half way. 	<br></span></p>

    	 <p style='margin: 30px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: "Arial";'><span style="font-kerning: none;"> To create the smaller parts around, I learned new tools including "project","create a new plane via offset" and "circular pattern". I split my circle into 32 equal parts, and as I project half of them onto the plane I created, I had 16 on each side of the wheel, which I then arranged to every other space.  I had another problem of having multiple parts in one part studio. I fixed it by using "Boolean" and substiting "extrude-add" for "extruded-new".

	This is the final result of my wheel.
